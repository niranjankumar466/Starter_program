# Starter_program
This is my first hackathon in Machine Learning. I have submitted some projects during the training, but it was differ from the those projects. There I am easily get the 84% AUC, but in this project, i have multiple decision tree and create the model then I got the 69% ACU with the help of ADA Boost.

# About the Project.
This is start Up based project. In this project I had some variable which was institute base data. We had to predict the student was deserve the admission or nor which was I have the variable is_pass. This is a categorical  variable. and we had to predict it.

# What I did in this project.
i did, load the data from AV, as we did. Then I did some EDA part and data cleaning, check NAN value,categorical, make them dummies. And finally create a model with the help of Adaboost Algorithms.
